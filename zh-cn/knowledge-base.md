# Using This Knowledge Base

## Welcome To MAS
Congratulations on your decision to automate your monetization! By choosing to use MAS, you've guaranteed your game will be making more money with less effort, so you can focus on what matters:

### Making great games.
This knowledge base was created to make sure you have the smoothest on-boarding experience with MAS possible. As a developer, we know your time is precious. That's why we are constantly working to make your experience as smooth and straightforward as possible.

There are a few features of the knowledge base we want to highlight. 

## The Organization
You'll find this knowledge base is separated into 3 sections: 

**Game Submission**, which is all the information you need to submit your game to the MAS portal. 

**Integration**, which covers how to integrate the Android and IOS SDKs, as well as the Unity Plugin.

**Pre-release**, where you'll find information on how to comply with Ad Network policies and legal frameworks that protect player privacy.

**IMPORTANT!** To get the most out of MAS, please complete every step in the knowledge base, unless it is clearly indicated as optional. On that note...

## The Signals

See that **IMPORTANT!** up there? It's one of the signals we use to tell you to pay attention. Here are the three signals to look out for and what they mean.

**IMPORTANT!** marks a message we strongly believe you need to pay attention to. We are all only human, and sometimes we either forget or ignore certain things. This marker makes sure you don't miss something important.

***Note*** is our way of telling you that something may be optional. We will explain when it is optional, and when it isn't, allowing you to skip past certain tasks.

## The Checklist 
We have created [a checklist](https://support.yodo1.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051732214) that includes top priority tasks for you to complete. Completing these tasks at the times mentioned in the checklist will lead to the best revenue with MAS. Please follow it and consult your assigned Yodo1 Business Developer if you have any questions or concerns.

And that's all, for now! If you have any feedback, on either this article, or any others, please reach out and let us know! For now, go ahead and submit your game to the MAS. You'll get an automatic confirmation when review is complete, and be on your way to making more with MAS.
