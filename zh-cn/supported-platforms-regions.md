# Supported Platforms and Regions

## What platforms does MAS support?

MAS was created for MOBILE games and applications. As such, we supported the two major global app stores.

**Google Play** and **Apple App Store**

The good news is, that's not where the power of MAS ends! We also provide an SDK for China's unique mobile application ecosystem. You can use MAS for monetization in China with:

**Android China**  and **China Apple App Store**

Why would you want to use a separate SDK for China?

First, there are local Chinese ad networks that would several MB of code to MAS Global if they were to be included. 

Second, certain ad networks do not operate in China, and thus the China MAS SDK is optimized for a smaller file size by removing those unnecessary Ad Networks. 

With that said, we almost always recommend a game or app use MAS Global, as most games and apps operate outside the borders of China.
