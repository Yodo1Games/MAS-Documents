# Submitting Your Revenue Metrics

## 1. What are Revenue Metrics?
Revenue metrics are information regarding the revenue your app has previously generated through ad monetization. Typical examples of a revenue metric include Daily Active Users (DAU), monthly revenue from an ad type, such as banners, and eCPMs for a given ad type.

## 2. Why does Yodo1 collect revenue metrics?
Your metrics help the Yodo1 monetization algorithms to better understand how your game makes money. This improves the results of the automated monetization, and helps accelerate the learning process for the algorithms.

## 3. When should I submit these metrics?
Please send the metrics 2 days before you release your game with MAS.
