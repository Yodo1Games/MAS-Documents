### IDFA issues on iPhone 12
We noticed that on some iPhone 12 devices the tracking feature is not able to be turned on, resulting in the acquired IDFA will be **000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000** This is an iOS system bug.
You can still turn it on with the following settings, but this is more dangerous and it is recommended that you back up your device first.
