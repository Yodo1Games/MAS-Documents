# FAN Configuration

***Note***: If you have never used FAN before in any way for your game, please skip this step. We have already configured it for you.

## What is FAN?
Facebook Audience Network (FAN) is a high eCPM ad network. When used with MAS, it can be a great option in scenarios where there are no strong alternatives.

## What do I need to do to configure FAN?
If you have previously used FAN in any way, there are processes for IOS and  Android. See below for details.

IOS

  1.Navigate to the end of this article to find the email template Yodo1 prepared for this process. 
  2.Change the text in the template to match your game.  You will find this information at the end of the article.
  3.Send the email, making sure that the email address you send it from is the one you used to set up your Facebook Audience Network account.
  
Android

  1.Please send an email to mas.cs@yodo1.com  or a message to your designated Customer Success Manager indicating you are ready to configure FAN.
  2.They will coordinate with you and enter the Yodo1 FAN account to have Facebook send an email to you.

## FAQ

**Q: By configuring FAN with MAS, do I lose access to other FAN services (UA, Marketing, Audience Engagement)?**</br>
A: Definitely not! The configuration simply allows Yodo1 to access to FAN monetization for your game, which is isolated from all other FAN services.

**Q: I got an email from Facebook after the configuration process. Is this normal?**</br>
A: Yes! This is just Facebook's way of acknowledging that another entity is using FAN monetization with your game. Since you helped us configure it, there is no need for concern!

**Q: If I decide to use FAN independently of MAS in the future, will I have problems?**</br>
A: Simply email mas.cs@yodo1.com that you would like to manage FAN monetization yourself, and they will remove your game's monetization property from the Yodo1 FAN account.
