# Supported Ad Formats

What kind of ads does MAS support?

MAS supports three ad formats.

**Banner Ads**

At present, MAS provides banner ads that are x by y pixels. Banners are a great way to make revenue without disrupting game play. However, many players find banners annoying for their adverse impact. We highly encourage you to explore other formats and keep banners to a minimum!

**Interstitial Ads**

Interstitial ads are full screen ads that come in one of three forms:

* Playable interstitial ads, where the user can play a game in the ad in order to get a sense of what it is like.
* Video interstitial ads, where the user must watch a video, and can skip after a certain interval.
* Static interstitial ads, which are the equivalent of full screen banners that the player must view for a certain interval.

Interstitial ads bring more revenue than banner ads, and are typically better accepted by players. However, we encourage developers to be thoughtful about where they place an interstitial ad. Games that place the ad in the middle of game play, particularly without warning the player, tend to lose users and/or get bad reviews.

**Rewarded Videos**

Rewarded videos, commonly referred to as RV, are videos the player chooses to watch in order to get a reward. Unlike other ads, a player chooses to watch a rewarded video, typically in order to gain assistance, in-game currency, or some other benefit in the game.

Rewarded videos are the BEST ad format in gaming and apps today. They have the highest eCPMs, can feel engaging to the user, and are chosen by the viewer, rather than forced upon them, making them the ideal User Experience.
