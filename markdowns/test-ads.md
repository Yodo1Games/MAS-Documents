## What Are Test Ads
MAS Test Ads for apps facilitates the ad implementation and ad content testing process for developers.


When you add an **non-live app** to your MAS account, it will remain in test ads until you set them to live. 


Test ads do not generate any revenue.


Once you have released the app to the app store and input url of the app on MAS then the app turns to live app.At this point, you will no longer be able to witch that specific app back to test ads, but you can receive test ad content on assigned test devices in the MAS Test Mode.
