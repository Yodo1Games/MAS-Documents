# Apple's App Privacy Questionnaire

According to [Apple’s](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/) requirements, starting December 8, 2020, app developers need to define which data is collected by their apps and the SDKs integrated in those apps.

The table below is a reference for what data is collected by MAS, and can be used to accurately answer Apple’s privacy questionnaire when submitting your game with MAS integrated.  

**Important:**

1.This information is only used to answer Apple’s privacy questionnaire, and is not intended to replace the MAS privacy policy. Developers are requested to read the [MAS Privacy Policy](https://www.yodo1.com/en/privacy) before integrating MAS.

2.Only data collected by MAS is described below. It does not include data collected indirectly by the SDK, or data collected by other SDKs you might be using.
