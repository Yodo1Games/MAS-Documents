# General Questions

## How long does it take to review app info?

It takes 1-2 days and review feedbacks will be sent to your registered email.

## What can you do when the app review state is pending?

This state will appear when Yodo1 MAS SDK is updated. The new version may require some more app information. If you are planning to update your game version, please submit your app information for reviewing again. If you have no plans to update your app, then just ignore the info.

## What should you do if you cannot see ads after completing integration?

Check to make sure MAS has been initialized successfully, which can be seen from your console.

## Do you need to request a new banner after one is displayed? And what is the refresh interval for a banner ad?

No, you don't. MAS sdk will request a new banner when one is displayed. And the banner refresh interval is about 30 seconds.

## Why is the Admob id generated on the MAS dashboard different from that Admob id in your Admob account?

The Admob id on the MAS dashboard is generated by the MAS account. Admob's SDK is embedded in MAS, and Admob can only be monetized successfully with the Admob id on MAS dashboard.
